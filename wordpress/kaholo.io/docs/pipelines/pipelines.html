<!--TITLE: Pipelines--><!--FILENAME: pipelines.html--><!--PARENT: none--><!--ORDER: 12--><p>When a pipeline is created or selected, Kaholo shows by default the Pipeline Designer View. This is a visual editor used to create, edit, and configure pipelines. It also activates the Pipeline Navigation Bar.</p>
<h2>Pipeline Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>Anytime a pipeline is open a horizontal pipeline navigation bar is displayed across the top of Kaholo. The bar contains the name of the pipeline, buttons to Save or Execute the pipeline, and the following pipeline-specific views:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designer - the default visual pipeline editor view</li>
    <li>Configurations - a view of JSON configurations applicable to the pipeline</li>
    <li>Inputs - a view of run-time inputs configured for the pipeline</li>
    <li>Executions - a view of current and past executions of the pipeline</li>
    <li>Revisions - a view of historical changes made to the pipeline, and</li>
    <li>Settings - a view of configurable details about the pipeline</li>
</ul>
