<!--TITLE: Pipeline Designer--><!--FILENAME: pipelines-designer.html--><!--PARENT: Pipelines--><!--ORDER: 2--><p>The Pipeline Designer view is the default when a pipeline is selected or created. This is a visual editor for creating, editing and configuring a pipeline. It can also be selected by clicking on "Designer" in the Pipeline navigation bar across the top of the display.</p>
<h2>Zoom and Pan</h2>
<p>Simple pipelines may fit in the design area nicely at standard resolution, but most pipelines will exceed the visible area of the display so it becomes necessary to zoom and pan.</p>
<p>Most web browsers have a zoom feature activated through a menu or using Cntl with the mouse wheel. This zoom can also be used with Kaholo, although it affects all elements in the display equally - not only the pipeline but the navigation and action side panels. It is suggested to use this feature only to adjust text to a comfortable reading size.</p>
<p>To zoom the pipeline design area alone, put the mouse cursor over any part of the design - even empty background - and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. The position of the mouse cursor remains fixed and is the center around which the pipeline diagram is zoomed in and out.</p>
<p>To pan, click and drag on any empty background area in the design.</p>

<h2>Add Items</h2>
<p>To add an item to a pipeline, mouse over any node in the pipeline displaying a plus sign (<code><b>+</b></code>) and click. A menu of categorized actions appears, including all installed plugins searchable by name or keywords.</p>

<h2>Edit Items</h2>
<p>Clicking on any item already in the pipeline opens the action side panel on the right side of the display. The action side panel includes icons to copy or delete the item, as well as configurable parameters that apply to the selected action.</p>
<p>Actions also have a quick menu at the top right, which appears as <code><b>...</b></code> when moused over.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><b>TIP: </b>Actions can be copied with <code style="font-size: 80%">Cntl-C</code> and then pasted by right-clicking on any (<code><b>+</b></code>) in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>YAML View</h2>
<p>Although created visually, the underlying pipeline and its configuration are stored as declarative YAML. The main purpose of this is to work well with GitOps, however a pipeline can be edited or even created as YAML if preferred. To switch the designer to YAML mode, click the small <code><b><></b></code> button near the top center of the display.</p>
